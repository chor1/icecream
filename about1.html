        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom:60px;"> During my time as a student at Gen bc joshi army public school, I had the privilege of residing in the Manekshaw house for a duration of five years, from 2018 to 2023. These years were not only crucial for my academic growth but also marked a period of cherished memories and enduring friendships.
            
            Manekshaw hostel, among the four hostels in the school, held a special place in our hearts. Its vibrant atmosphere, coupled with the camaraderie among its residents, made it stand out as the best among them. Within its walls, I experienced moments of laughter, learning, and camaraderie that have left an indelible mark on my life.
            
            Despite the rules against it, indulging in late-night Maggie sessions became somewhat of a tradition among us residents. These clandestine gatherings, filled with laughter and banter, added an extra layer of warmth to our hostel life.
            
            Moreover, Manekshaw hostel provided ample opportunities for recreational activities. From inter house sports tournaments or simply lounging in the common room after a long day of classes, there was never a dull moment. Engaging in these activities not only fostered a spirit of healthy competition but also strengthened the bonds of friendship among us.
            
            Reflecting on my time at Manekshaw hostel fills me with nostalgia and gratitude. It was more than just a place of residence; it was a home away from home where I forged lifelong friendships and created memories that I will cherish forever.Throughout my stay, Manekshaw Hostel has been witness to some of the most unforgettable moments of my school life. The bond I shared with my friends here transcended mere dormitory walls; it was a bond forged in the fires of late-night conversations,and late-night Maggie and chicken eating sessions. Amidst the bustling hostel life,Despite the rules forbidding such indulgences, we reveled in the thrill of breaking them, adding an extra dash of excitement to our hostel escapades.
